### About

In recent years, with the advancements in computation power and data storage, the use of statistical learning has been able to dramatically increase and spread across industries. One specific field benefiting from these approaches is neuroscience. This repository showcases my work in the field of neuroscience.

#### Projects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`p1`**     &nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury data

>In this project for my Master's degree, I implemented the Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm. The dataset I utilized was produced from a collaborative study on Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. Although my background is not in the arena of neuroscience, the topic hits me on a personal level. My grandfather passed away as a result of Alzheimer's disease and I have always wanted to understand the illness more since there is a chance myself or another family member might fall victim to it.

>Given the complexity of the dataset and numerous approaches, I focused initially on diagnostics. As a result of performing PCA on my subcategories, I determined that proteins - ab42 and ab40 - were the "main influencers" in the first two principal components. Additionally, a noteworthy find, the protein rantes supplanted ab40 as an influencer only within the Dementia subgroups. [ Rantes are believed to have some 'protective power' in individuals with Dementia to slow or prevent the progression into Alzheimer's. ] After my own researching, I validated that my results aligned with current evidence and practice in the field.
