Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury data

### Phase I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`PCA.ipynb`**     &nbsp;&nbsp; Principal Component Analysis:
Understanding & Applying to Neuroscience Data

>In this project for my Master's degree, I implemented the Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm. The dataset I utilized was produced from a collaborative study on Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury. Although my background is not in the arena of neuroscience, the topic hits me on a personal level. My grandfather passed away as a result of Alzheimer's disease and I have always wanted to understand the illness more since there is a chance myself or another family member might fall victim to it.

>Given the complexity of the dataset and numerous approaches, I focused initially on diagnostics. As a result of performing PCA on my subcategories, I determined that proteins - ab42 and ab40 - were the "main influencers" in the first two principal components. Additionally, a noteworthy find, the protein rantes supplanted ab40 as an influencer only within the Dementia subgroups. [ Rantes are believed to have some 'protective power' in individuals with Dementia to slow or prevent the progression into Alzheimer's. ] After my own researching, I validated that my results aligned with current evidence and practice in the field.
